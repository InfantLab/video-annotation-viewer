# Video Annotation Viewer v0.6.0 Roadmap

**Theme:** JOSS Paper & Public Release  
**Status:** 📋 PLANNED  
**Target Date:** Q2 2026 (after VideoAnnotator v1.4.0 release)  
**Previous Version:** v0.5.0 (VideoAnnotator v1.3.0 Integration - October 2025)

---

## 🎯 **OVERVIEW**

v0.6.0 is a **tightly scoped release** focused exclusively on JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software) paper submission and public release readiness. This version delivers the minimum viable documentation, demo data, and quality improvements required for academic publication.

**Dependency:** VideoAnnotator server v1.4.0 must be released first (provides stable API and complete feature set for documentation).

### **2. Demo Data Regeneration** 🎬

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL (Required for JOSS examples)

- [ ] **Re-process all demo videos** with VideoAnnotator v1.4.x
  - Use latest stable pipeline configurations
  - Ensure all annotation types represented (faces, poses, audio, scenes)
