# Specification Quality Checklist: VideoAnnotator Server v1.3.0 Client Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ Spec focuses on user scenarios, requirements, and outcomes without prescribing React, TypeScript, or specific libraries

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ Each user story clearly articulates value proposition (resource management, error prevention, security, UX improvement)

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ User stories use plain language; technical terms are explained in context; acceptance criteria use Given/When/Then format

- [x] All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User Scenarios & Testing: 5 prioritized stories with acceptance scenarios
  - ✅ Requirements: 14 functional requirements with key entities
  - ✅ Success Criteria: 7 measurable outcomes
  - ✅ Additional sections: Assumptions, Out of Scope, Dependencies, Risks

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
  - ✅ All requirements are concrete and actionable; reasonable assumptions documented in Assumptions section

- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ Each FR specifies exact endpoints, UI controls, or behaviors; acceptance scenarios provide clear pass/fail criteria

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - ✅ All SC items include specific metrics: time thresholds (5 seconds, 1 second, 2 seconds), percentages (95%, 80%, 100%), counts (zero errors)

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - ✅ Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes and performance metrics, not implementation approaches

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ 20 total acceptance scenarios across 5 user stories covering normal flows, error cases, and edge conditions

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ 7 edge cases documented covering race conditions, version compatibility, network failures, and state transitions

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ Out of Scope section explicitly excludes server-side features, CLI tools, infrastructure concerns, and pipeline development

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ Dependencies list server availability, API documentation, testing resources, and UI component support
  - ✅ Assumptions document server behavior, authentication standards, browser requirements, and network expectations

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ Each FR maps to user stories with detailed acceptance scenarios; FR-001 through FR-014 all testable

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ P1 priorities cover critical capabilities (cancellation, validation); P2 covers important UX (auth, errors); P3 covers nice-to-have (diagnostics)

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ Success criteria align with user stories: SC-001 (cancellation), SC-002 (validation), SC-003 (auth), SC-004 (errors), SC-005 (compatibility), SC-006 (diagnostics), SC-007 (reliability)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ Spec references API endpoints and response formats from server documentation but doesn't prescribe client implementation approach

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality checks passed

**Summary**:
- Content Quality: 4/4 items passed
- Requirement Completeness: 8/8 items passed
- Feature Readiness: 4/4 items passed

**Notes**:
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed; all ambiguities resolved with documented assumptions
- User stories are independently testable with clear value propositions
- Success criteria provide concrete, measurable targets for implementation validation
- Backward compatibility explicitly addressed in FR-005, FR-014, and SC-005

**Next Steps**:
- ✅ Ready for `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- ✅ Ready for `/speckit.clarify` if stakeholder questions arise
- Consider reviewing with VideoAnnotator server team to confirm endpoint specifications match implementation
