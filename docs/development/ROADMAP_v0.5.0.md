### **E. Modular Pipeline Architecture Research**

#### E1. Current State Analysis
- **Monolithic Container Issues**:
  - Large Docker image size
  - All-or-nothing deployment
  - Difficult to update individual pipelines
  - Resource inefficiency (running unused pipelines)
  - Slower development cycles

#### E2. Research & Feasibility Study
- **Architecture Options**:
  - **Option 1**: Microservices - separate containers per pipeline
  - **Option 2**: Plugin system - dynamic loading of pipeline modules
  - **Option 3**: Serverless functions - on-demand pipeline execution
  - **Option 4**: Hybrid approach - core + optional modules

- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - Deployment complexity
  - Resource efficiency
  - Development/maintenance burden
  - Backward compatibility
  - Performance impact
  - User experience (installation/setup)

#### E3. Proof of Concept
- **Target Pipelines**: Start with 1-2 pipelines as POC
- **Interface Design**: Standard contract between core and modules
- **Testing**: Performance comparison vs monolithic
- **Documentation**: Migration guide if successful

#### E4. Decision Point
- **Go/No-Go**: Decide if modular architecture is worth the migration effort
- **Timeline**: If Go â†’ v0.6.0 feature; if No-Go â†’ document reasons
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing deployments continue working

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¢ Low-Medium (research phase, not blocking release)  
**Effort:** Large (4-6 weeks for research + POC)  
**Risk:** High (architectural change, may not be feasible)  
**Note:** This may become the primary focus of v0.6.0 if scope is large
