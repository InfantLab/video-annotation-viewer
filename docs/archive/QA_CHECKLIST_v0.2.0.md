## 2. Person Tracking Overlay Tests (CRITICAL)

### YOLO/Ultralytics Skeleton Rendering

- [x] **Proper connections**: ✅ 2025-08-06
  - Nose connects to eyes/ears
  - Arms: shoulder → elbow → wrist
  - Legs: hip → knee → ankle
  - Torso connections present
    
### Tracking Verification
- [x] **Multiple people**: If >1 person, each has different colored bounding box ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Track IDs**: Person bounding boxes show "ID:X" labels ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Temporal consistency**: Person tracking follows individuals across frames ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **No phantom overlays**: Overlays disappear when people leave frame ✅ 2025-08-06

---

## 3. File Format Support Tests

### VideoAnnotator V1.1.1 Complete Results
- [x] `complete_results.json` files detected correctly ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] Person tracking data extracts from `pipeline_results.person.results` ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] Face analysis data extracts from `pipeline_results.face.results` ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] Scene detection data extracts from `pipeline_results.scene.results` ✅ 2025-08-06

### Legacy Format Support - not required
- [x] Individual JSON files for person tracking still work
- [x] WebVTT files for speech recognition load correctly
- [x] RTTM files for speaker diarization parse successfully

---

## 4. Overlay Controls Tests

### Toggle Functionality
- [x] **Pose toggle**: ON/OFF switches skeleton rendering ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Subtitles toggle**: ON/OFF switches speech text overlay ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Speakers toggle**: ON/OFF switches speaker diarization display ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Scenes toggle**: ON/OFF switches scene detection labels ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Faces toggle**: ON/OFF switches face detection boxes ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Emotions toggle**: ON/OFF switches emotion labels ✅ 2025-08-06


### Visual Verification
- [x] All enabled overlays render simultaneously without conflicts ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] Overlay settings persist during video playback ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] No performance degradation with all overlays enabled ✅ 2025-08-06

However there is different behaviour between pipelines.  Speaker and subtitle stay present for duration of event. This is good. The skeleton renders for a give frame and then stays present until the next predicted frame. 
All other pipelines only seem to render on the frame and next 6 frames. Unclear if this is because there are sparse predictions.  Think we make this consistent with our PredictionsPerSecond rates from the pipelines. But this information doesn't seem to be available to the viewer is . we need to raise an github issue in VideoAnnotator. 
Speaker ID and Subtitles not yet combined
Subtitles still rendering below the screen

## 5. Timeline and Playback Tests

### Video Controls
- [x] **Play/Pause**: Space bar or button toggles playback ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Seeking**: Click timeline or use slider to jump to time ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Frame stepping**: Arrow keys advance/rewind by single frames ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Playback speed**: 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x options work ✅ 2025-08-06
- The speaker button on controls doesn't toggle sound on/off.

### Timeline Tracks
- [x] **Subtitle track**: Shows WebVTT speech recognition segments ✅ 2025-08-06
      Next we should put the words on the timeline too.
      Audio wave form is already on the list but we should group it with other audio tracks
- [x] **Speaker track**: Shows RTTM diarization segments ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Scene track**: Shows scene detection boundaries ✅ 2025-08-06
- [>] **Motion track**: Shows person tracking activity (if implemented)
      Should have one track per person - that tracks their average x ordinate (centre of bbox)
      Partially - we ought to create a motion intensity algorithm (something industry standard)

## 6. Error Handling and Edge Cases

### File Detection Issues
- [x] **Unknown files**: Gracefully handle unsupported file types ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Malformed JSON**: Show helpful error messages ✅ 2025-08-06
	almost - currently says 'unknown file type'
- [f] **Missing data**: Handle empty pipeline results
      Need to improve loading screen (see above)
- [>] **Large files**: Performance acceptable for >10MB annotation files

### Playback Edge Cases
- [x] **Video start/end**: Overlays behave correctly at 0s and end time ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Rapid seeking**: No overlay rendering artifacts during fast seeks ✅ 2025-08-06
- [x] **Browser resize**: Canvas overlays scale correctly with window size

---

## 7. Performance Tests

### Loading Performance
- [x] **Demo loading**: Completes within 5 seconds ✅ 2025-08-06
- [>] **Large datasets**: >1000 person tracking entries load without freezing
- [>] **Memory usage**: No obvious memory leaks during extended use

### Rendering Performance
- [f] **Smooth playback**: 30fps video maintains smooth overlay rendering
- [f] **Multiple people**: Performance acceptable with 3+ people in frame
- [f] **All overlays**: No significant lag with all overlay types enabled
- Some timing issues with the VEATIC 3.mp4 Patch Adams video. It also doesn't show good tracking for all the people in the video. But this might be a problem with the VideoAnnotator pipeline. So needs further investigation.
