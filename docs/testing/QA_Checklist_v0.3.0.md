## üìã **SECTION 1: VideoAnnotator API Integration**

### **1.1 API Client & Connection**
- [x] **API Health Check**: `http://localhost:8000/health` returns status  
- [f] **Detailed Health**: `/api/v1/system/health` provides system information  
- [p] **Authentication**: API token authentication works correctly  
- [x] **Error Handling**: Network errors display appropriate messages  
- [x] **Environment Variables**: VITE_API_BASE_URL and VITE_API_TOKEN configurable  

**Issues Found:**
```
intitially detailed health url gave {"detail":"Not Found"}. But then gave full check details.
how do tell that API token is working? What does user do if it isn't?
```

### **1.2 Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
- [ ] **SSE Connection**: EventSource connects to `/api/v1/events/stream`  
- [ ] **Job-Specific SSE**: Job ID filtering works correctly  
- [ ] **Event Types**: Handles job.update, job.log, job.complete, job.error events  
- [ ] **Reconnection**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff  
- [ ] **Connection Status**: isConnected state updates correctly  
- [ ] **Event History**: Maintains last 100 events in memory  

**Issues Found:**
```
SSE Disconnected
:8000/api/v1/events/stream?token=dev-token:1   Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
SSEContext.tsx:33 SSE Disconnected
:8000/api/v1/events/stream?token=dev-token:1   Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
hook.js:608  SSE Error: Error: SSE connection failed after maximum retry attempts
    at eventSource.onerror (useSSE.ts:140:25)
```

## üìã **SECTION 2: Navigation & Routing**

### **2.1 Route Structure** 
- [ ] **Main Routes**: `/` (viewer), `/create` (annotation jobs) work  
- [ ] **Create Sub-routes**: `/create/jobs`, `/create/new`, `/create/datasets` accessible  
- [ ] **Job Details**: `/create/jobs/:id` displays job-specific information  
- [x] **Navigation Menu**: Links to Create Annotations section present  
- [x] **Back Navigation**: Back buttons work correctly throughout wizard  

**Issues Found:**
```
[List any routing/navigation issues]
```

## üìã **SECTION 3: Job Creation Wizard**

### **3.1 Step 1: Video Upload**
- [x] **File Selection**: Video file picker accepts MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV  
- [x] **File Information**: Displays name, size, type after selection  
- [x] **File Validation**: Rejects non-video files appropriately  
- [>] **Large Files**: Handles files >100MB without crashing  
- [x] **Progress Indicator**: Step progress shows 25% completion  
- [x] **Next Button**: Disabled until file selected, enabled after  

**Test Files:** Upload various video formats and sizes  
**Issues Found:**
```
All pages in v-a-v ought to show our icon next to name. 
Let's match colour scheme of UI to complement main colours in icon. (do this with minimal hardcoding)
All pages should have our standard footer.
version 0.4.0: Would be useful to have a 'select folder' option. 
```

### **3.2 Step 2: Pipeline Selection**
- [ ] **Pipeline Options**: Scene Detection, Person Tracking, Face Analysis, Audio Processing shown  
- [ ] **Checkboxes**: All pipelines checked by default  
- [ ] **Descriptions**: Each pipeline shows appropriate description text  
- [ ] **Toggle States**: Can check/uncheck individual pipelines  
- [ ] **Progress Indicator**: Shows 50% completion  
- [ ] **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons functional  

**Issues Found:**
```
+ UI uses lots of dark gray text on black background - hard to read.
+ The Select Pipelines page is very basic. Needs to give detailed information about each possible pipeline
and give control over all of them. 
Face pipeline doesn't list all opions. 
Audio pipeline doesn't separate pyannote, whisper and LAION.
I guess we need a mechanism for VideoAnnotator to provide this information. 


```

### **3.3 Step 3: Configuration**
- [ ] **Default Config**: Shows JSON configuration preview  
- [ ] **Config Display**: Contains scene_detection, person_tracking, face_analysis, audio_processing  
- [ ] **Parameters**: Default values match expected pipeline settings  
- [ ] **Progress Indicator**: Shows 75% completion  
- [ ] **Config Validation**: (Future: ensure valid JSON structure)  

**Issues Found:**
```
+ Configure Pipelines json box has white text on white background! More generally, page is no use to a naive user. As first step we must give simple on screen example of available options. As a further step we should make this into a proper UI. For example many pipelines have some params in common (predictions per second - i think) and so could make some controls as well as raw json. 
Finally, we ought to have a mechanism to remember users last choices or preferences.

```

### **3.4 Step 4: Review & Submit**
- [x] **File Summary**: Shows selected video file name  
- [x] **Pipeline Summary**: Lists all selected pipelines  
- [x] **Time Estimate**: Displays "~5-10 minutes" estimate  
- [p] **Submit Button**: Does it work  
- [x] **Progress Indicator**: Shows 100% completion  
- [p] **Final Review**: All information accurate  

**Issues Found:**
```
Feels like this page also ought to specify and let us modify db location and output directory location. 

```
