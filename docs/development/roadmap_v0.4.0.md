- Build & Types
  - [ ] Vite production build succeeds (no warnings promoted to errors)
  - [ ] TypeScript typecheck (tsc --noEmit) passes
  - [ ] ESLint passes (no error-level rules)

- Tests & Coverage
  - [ ] Vitest unit/integration tests pass on CI
  - [ ] Test coverage meets thresholds (proposed defaults):
        Lines ‚â• 80%, Branches ‚â• 70%, Functions ‚â• 80%, Statements ‚â• 80%
  - [ ] Codecov upload succeeds; coverage badge reflects latest main

- E2E & Cross-browser
  - [ ] Playwright smoke tests pass (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
  - [ ] Core flows: load demo, toggle overlays, seek/timeline, job list open

- Accessibility & Performance
  - [ ] Lighthouse CI: Performance ‚â• 90, Accessibility ‚â• 90, Best Practices ‚â• 90
  - [ ] Axe checks pass on key pages (no critical violations)

- Bundle & Security
  - [ ] Bundle size budgets respected (e.g., app chunk < 300KB gzip; vendor < 500KB)
  - [ ] npm audit (production) shows 0 high/critical vulnerabilities

- Docs & Release Hygiene
  - [ ] CHANGELOG updated and version bumped
  - [ ] README badges and screenshots updated

  - [ ] Require PR reviews and linear history
  - [ ] Require up-to-date with base branch

Implementation notes (for later enablement):
- Coverage thresholds: set in `vitest.config.ts -> test.coverage.thresholds`.
- Codecov: repo connected; token only needed for private repos.
- Playwright: add `@playwright/test`, basic smoke specs, and GitHub Action.
- Lighthouse CI: add `@lhci/cli` with minimal config and CI step.
- Size budgets: add `size-limit` (or vite-plugin bundle analyzer) with CI step.
- Branch protection: configure in GitHub settings when RC branch is cut.
