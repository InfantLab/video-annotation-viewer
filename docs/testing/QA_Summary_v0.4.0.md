## 🔧 **ISSUES FOUND & FIXED**

### **During Testing:**

#### **1. Token Authentication (401 Errors)** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Initial load showed 401 Unauthorized errors  
**Root Cause:** Empty/incorrect token defaults in `.env`  
**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `.env` file with correct defaults
- Improved token initialization in `TokenSetup.tsx`
- Added automatic localStorage sync in `APIClient`

**Result:** Clean authentication, no 401 errors

---

#### **2. OpenFace3 Individual Toggles Disabled** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Individual feature toggles grayed out for demo data  
**Root Cause:** Demo data lacks job pipeline metadata (`jobPipelines` array empty)  
**Fix Applied:**
- Updated availability logic to fall back to data-based checks when no job info
- Improved "Toggle All" button logic

**Result:** Toggles work for demo data, proper capability detection when job metadata available

---

#### **3. Toggle All Button Not Working** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** "Toggle All" button appeared non-responsive  
**Root Cause:** Logic checking all features instead of available features  
**Fix Applied:**
- Improved logic to check which features are actually available and enabled

**Result:** Button works correctly

## 📋 **NON-BLOCKING ITEMS (v0.5.0)**

### **1. Demo Data Regeneration** 🟡 Workaround Applied
**Issue:** Demo data lacks job metadata  
**Impact:** Cannot fully test capability-aware features  
**Workaround:** Fallback logic implemented  
**Action:** Added to v0.5.0 Phase 1 (marked URGENT)  
**Document:** `docs/development/Demo_Data_Regeneration.md` created

### **2. Job Deletion Feature** 🟢 Feature Request
**Issue:** Users cannot delete failed jobs  
**Impact:** 6 failed jobs visible during testing  
**Action:** Added to v0.5.0 roadmap (Section C)  
**Priority:** High (quality of life)
